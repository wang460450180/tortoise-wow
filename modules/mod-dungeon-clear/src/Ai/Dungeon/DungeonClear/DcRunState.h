// The authoritative, leader-owned state of one dungeon-clear RUN — the run's
// identity/mode, its current manual-override objective, and the two cross-bot
// leader-fight signals that used to live in translation-unit-static maps. Owned
// as a single value (DungeonClearRunStateValue, "dungeon clear run state") so the
// whole run resets in lockstep through named transitions, exactly like the
// sub-feature structs DcApproachState and DcPullContext already do one level down.
//
// This is the third and last of the "one struct, one Reset()" consolidations that
// each ended a recurring "the X is flaky" family. DcApproachState fixed the
// approach FSM; DcPullContext fixed the pull FSM; DcRunState fixes the PARTY/RUN
// level — the enabled/paused/pause-cluster/selected-boss values whose resets were
// hand-replicated (as slightly different subsets) across DisableDungeonClear and
// the DcOn/Off/Skip/Go/Resume chat-action clusters, plus the leader-combat-since
// and party-engaged latches that were file-static maps each with their own mutex.
// A stale latch surviving a pause / skip / resume / boss-change was the single
// most common root cause in the whole bug log; folding these here so exactly one
// Reset() clears them makes that class structurally impossible.
//
// Add a new run-level field HERE (never as a separate value) so it can never be
// forgotten by a reset.
//
// Leader-owned. Followers read `enabled`/`paused` cross-context through the
// leader's copy of this value (DcLeaderSignal::IsInPausedDungeonClearRun and the
// party-tank / camp-hold gates), the same pattern DcPullContext uses. Each bot
// still holds its OWN DcRunState value; a follower's stays at defaults (it never
// leads a run) and reading it is harmless.
//
// NOTE on the pull PREFERENCE: the advanced-pull tri-state (`dungeon clear pull
// setting`) and its behavioral bool (`dungeon clear pull mode`) are deliberately
// NOT folded in here. Their lifetime is the odd one out — the preference is
// settable BEFORE a run and must survive the disabled window to be applied by
// `dc on`, and toggling it live is coupled to daze-immunity + camp-seed side
// effects (DungeonClearChatActions::ApplyPullSetting). They are already funneled
// through ApplyPullSetting / DisableDungeonClear and are excluded from every
// blanket reset anyway, so folding them here would add surface without any
// reset-safety gain. They stay as their own values.
