// Passive route recorder.
//
// Every successful clear walks a usable path to each boss and, until now, threw
// it away: Advance recomputes the route from the navmesh on every TTL and keeps
// nothing. Meanwhile DungeonClearRouteRegistry — the hand-authored anchor table
// that Advance PREFERS over the long-range router (snap-only, no A*) — shipped
// exactly one route in the whole repo.
//
// This closes that loop. While a dc run is driving, the leader's position is
// sampled cheaply; when a boss dies, the samples since the previous boss are
// thinned to ~15yd anchors and appended to a per-map source file under
// modules/mod-dungeon-clear/routes/. Those files are ordinary C++ appenders in
// the same shape as the authored ones, so a recorded route is repo content:
// commit it and every later run — here and on any other server running the
// module — walks the proven path instead of re-deriving it.
//
// Deliberately passive: recording never influences the run it observes. A route
// only becomes live once its generated file is compiled in.
