// All transient per-approach state for one boss-approach run, owned as a single
// value (DungeonClearApproachStateValue, "dungeon clear approach state") so the
// whole advance state machine resets in lockstep through exactly one Reset().
// This replaced nine loose ManualSetValue globals — the position-stuck and
// MoveTo-noop counters, the consecutive-rebuild count, the direct-pursuit and
// path-ends-short give-up latches, the loot-yield commit anchor, the position
// sentinel + last committed boss entry, and the long-path cache state — whose
// resets were scattered across two free functions in the action TU and ~25
// inline ->Set(0u) calls in the chat actions, kept in sync by hand. That was
// the identical failure mode the pull FSM fixed: "the approach is flaky" almost
// always meant "one of N globals didn't reset in lockstep" (a stale latch
// surviving pause / skip / resume / boss change).
//
// Add a new per-approach field HERE (never as a separate value) so it can never
// be forgotten by a reset. Mirrors DcPullContext. The two named subset resets
// (OnBossChange / OnEnteredEngageRange) replace the old ResetApproachOn* free
// functions so the reset subsets are named, visible, and co-located instead of
// inline ->Set(0u) clusters.
