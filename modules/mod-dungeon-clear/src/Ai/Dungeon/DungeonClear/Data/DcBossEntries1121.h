// Which creature entries count as dungeon bosses on a 1.12 core.
//
// Upstream builds its boss index from DungeonEncounter.dbc. That DBC arrived
// with Wrath; a 1.12 client has no encounter data at all, and creature rank
// cannot stand in for it - Deadmines has VanCleef and his trash both at rank 1.
//
// This list is the curated one from the Kith project's kith_boss table (133
// bosses across the classic instances, Molten Core and Onyxia included),
// baked in as data rather than read from a table so the module works on a
// realm that never imported it. Everything else the index needs - map, spawn
// coordinates, name - joins in from the spawn and template data at load.
//
// Ordering: DungeonEncounter carried an explicit per-dungeon order; this list
// does not. Maps present in DC_BOSS_ORDER_1121 below get the authored order
// (and any door bosses the curated list lacks); every other map falls back to
// ascending-entry numbering. The fallback is NOT harmless in door dungeons:
// live, a Deadmines party routed to Mr. Smite first (lowest reachable index)
// straight past Rhahk'Zor's closed door and walked off the navmesh - add an
// order block when a dungeon misroutes.
