/*
 * mod-dungeon-clear — DungeonClearModule.cpp
 *
 * Drop-in glue against STOCK mod-playerbots. Two scripts:
 *
 *  1. WorldScript — on the first world-update tick (guaranteed after
 *     playerbots' OnBeforeWorldInitialized -> PlayerbotAIConfig::Initialize ->
 *     AiObjectContext::BuildAllSharedContexts has built every shared context),
 *     append the four DungeonClear contexts into the engine's shared
 *     registries. Doing it on the first tick (not in our own
 *     OnBeforeWorldInitialized) sidesteps any module hook-ordering race.
 *
 *     CRITICAL: playerbots does NOT use one global registry. Each bot is built
 *     by AiFactory from a PER-CLASS context (WarriorAiObjectContext, …), and
 *     each of those declares its OWN shared static lists. The base
 *     AiObjectContext lists are only the fallback for class 0 (no real bot).
 *     So we must append into all ten class registries — appending into the
 *     base alone reaches no bot (that was the "dc on: unknown action" bug).
 *     The per-class lists are PUBLIC statics, so we touch them directly; only
 *     the base lists are private, reached via AiObjectContextAccess.h.
 *
 *  2. PlayerScript — on login, apply the single "dungeon clear" strategy to a
 *     bot's non-combat engine. It bundles the party-chat keyword listener
 *     (`dc on`, …), the driving advance/engage/stall ladder, and the
 *     follow-tank trigger. Resident on ALL bots but inert unless that bot's own
 *     "dungeon clear enabled" flag is set — every driving trigger and the
 *     multiplier gate on the flag, and follow-tank no-ops on the tank itself.
 *     Keeping it on every bot (mirroring the AiFactory add stock playerbots
 *     used to carry) is what lets non-tank party bots redirect their follow
 *     target to the tank while a tank has DC enabled, and revert to the player
 *     when it's off — driven purely by the tank's flag (see
 *     DungeonClearPartyTankValue / DungeonClearFollowTankTrigger).
 *
 *     This login hook is a zero-config convenience for bots present at login.
 *     The reliable universal path — and the ONLY one that reaches a self-bot
 *     created mid-session via `.playerbots bot self`, OR survives a
 *     ResetStrategies() (master/group change, talent change, instance entry) —
 *     is having the strategy in the playerbots default strategy set. The
 *     registrar above now injects "+dungeon clear" into that set in code (the
 *     four sPlayerbotAIConfig strategy strings), so no manual
 *     `AiPlayerbot.NonCombatStrategies = "+dungeon clear"` conf line is needed.
 *     The `.dc` slash command (DungeonClearCommand.cpp) needs neither, since it
 *     dispatches the action directly.

//
//   Map::Update(A) -> Player::Update -> PlayerbotMgr::UpdateSessions

//
// (crash_2026-08-28_10-20-07, three map threads live, the bot mid-worldport.
// Note the nesting too: RpgStrategy::OnStrategyRemoved re-enters

// The pull walk-in's brake, wired to the combat flag itself.
//
// This is the one thing in the pull FSM that CANNOT be an AI action, because the
// whole defect is that an AI action arrives too late: the bot is still on the
// non-combat engine when its pack notices it, so a flip has to happen before the
// drag-back can run, and the MotionMaster walks the tank further into the formation
// for the whole of that gap. No player-level combat hook on this engine, but

// WORKAROUND for an upstream Zul'Farrak core-script typo (fixed on branch
// fix/zf-sezziz-summon-coords): Shadowpriest Sezz'ziz's summon table lists
// several add coords as x=895 instead of 1895, so during his fight he summons
// Sandfury Acolytes/Zealots ~1000yd OUTSIDE the temple. There they are
// unreachable and never die, holding the whole party in combat indefinitely —
// which freezes the DungeonClear temple event, whose end gossips (open the door,
// then fight Bly) run on the NON-combat engine and so never get a tick. We can't
// fix that in SQL (the coords are hardcoded in C++), so until the core fix is
// deployed this hook despawns the stray adds the instant they spawn, letting
// combat end and the event finish.
//
// Surgical: only Sandfury Acolyte/Zealot SUMMONS on the Zul'Farrak map that
// appear far WEST of the temple (x < 1500; the temple sits at x~1873-1902, so no
// legitimate creature is there). The pyramid-wave summons of the same entries
// spawn at the correct x (>1873) and are untouched. Despawn is deferred a beat so
// it can't dangle the pointer the summon caller uses right after SummonCreature
// (Sezz'ziz calls AttackStart on the fresh add); 1000yd away, the few-hundred-ms
// of phantom threat before despawn is harmless.

// party in combat forever — the same class of bug as the Zul'Farrak stray-summon
// hook above, and likewise unfixable for us in core. instance_sunken_temple.cpp's
// SetData(DATA_ERANIKUS_FIGHT) throws EVERY loaded dragonkin in the temple into
// combat with the whole zone via Creature::SetInCombatWithZone(). The scattered
// ones that can't path to the party never reach it and never trip their home
// leash, so once the Shade is dead they keep a combat reference on every party
// member indefinitely — killing the adds that DID reach the party never clears the
// stranded ones, and the DungeonClear run then freezes on its "party not ready /
// resting" gate. The core instance script never resets these minions on the
// Shade's own death (its OnUnitDeath handles only Jammal'an), and we can't patch
// core, so do that cleanup here: when the Shade of Eranikus dies, evade every
// still-stranded awakened dragonkin so the party drops combat and the run
// continues. Scoped strictly to the Shade's death on map 109; universal (helps
// real players too), not gated on DungeonClear.
// Feeds DcEncounterMask: a dungeon creature death whose entry is in the boss
// index sets that boss's mask bit for the instance. This IS the kill signal
// every mask reader consumes - without it no boss ever counts as killed on
