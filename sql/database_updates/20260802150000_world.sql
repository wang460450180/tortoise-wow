-- The Syndicate quartermaster sold one item out of thirteen.
--
-- Thirteen items are gated behind reputation with faction 70, the Syndicate, and
-- they read as a designed ladder: item level 30 at Honored, 40 at Revered, 50
-- and 62-63 at the top, with buy prices from 17 silver to 32 gold. Nobody sets
-- buy prices on loot.
--
-- Anna Lacroix (80946, "Syndicate Quartermaster") had exactly one row in
-- npc_vendor - the Syndicate Mask. The other twelve existed in item_template,
-- correctly gated, and were sold by nobody at all. That is an import that
-- stopped early, not a design.
--
-- No condition_id is needed. Player::BuyItemFromVendor checks
-- RequiredReputationFaction and RequiredReputationRank itself and answers
-- BUY_ERR_REPUTATION_REQUIRE, so the rank on each item is the gate. maxcount 0
-- and incrtime 0 mean unlimited stock, matching the row that was already there.
--
-- Slots are numbered in the order the ladder is climbed, so the list reads from
-- the cheapest rank to the highest rather than by item id.
